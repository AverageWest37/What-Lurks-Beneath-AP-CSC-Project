# What-Lurks-Beneath-AP-CSC-Project
This game was made for my AP computer science class in high school. The goal is to turn all the valves, and avoid enemies. Friend added items so that may be a bit buggy. 

Controls are: WASD to move, SHIFT toggles (dont hold it) sprint, F interact with valves, X see valves through walls when some are turned, E to pick up item and use it, Q to "select" item.

Note this is kinda poorly coded (rushing + first time = not fun), and trying to add the item classes did NOT go smoothly. 
I really wanted to experiment with a fog of war style sight, and incorperate that into a game wher eyou have to survive. It was also (mostly) fun trying to code pathfidning, as I learned it all from scratch and somehow made little goobers move on their own!
I also left my dev tools in there so be careful pushing random buttons :).


**DOWNLOADING**
Simply just make a new Java project in your IDE, and replace the src with this one, and also put the graphics folder in the project folder. It'll hopefully go fine.
