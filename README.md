# What-Lurks-Beneath-AP-CSC-Project
This game was made for my AP computer science class in high school. The goal is to turn all the valves, and avoid enemies. Friend added items so that may be a bit buggy. Controls are: WASD to move, SHIFT toggles sprint, F interact with pipes, X see pipes through walls when some are turned, E to pick up item and use it, Q to "select" item.
